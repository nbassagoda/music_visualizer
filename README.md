# Music Visualizer
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for coding within the context of the visual arts. This app provides a music visualizer developed in Processing and usig the audio library Minim. Minim uses the JavaSound API , a bit of Tritonus, and Javazoom's MP3SPI to provide an easy to use audio library for people developing in the Processing environment. The philosophy behind the API is to make integrating audio into your sketches as simple as possible while still providing a reasonable amount of flexibility.
